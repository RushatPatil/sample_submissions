Analyze the contents of a provided GenAI project which is already extracted at the path (file_id : {file_id}), and generate a fully-automated Python script that sets up, runs, and extracts results from the project with no manual intervention.

**Do not perform any extraction of files. Assume the project directory is fully available at the specified path and all file locations (including output) are accessible for reading and execution.** The script should only read the output file as indicated and not modify any project files.

Carefully review the project structure and codebase (including requirements, entry points, and output formats). Construct a Python script that executes the following workflow:

- Creates an isolated Python virtual environment in a project-specific directory.
- Installs all required packages, referencing any dependencies/requirements files present.
- Identifies the appropriate method to run the project (e.g. Flask server, CLI tool, etc.).
- Executes the project according to its launch method. If it is a Flask application, launch the endpoint; if CLI, invoke the correct commands.
- Accepts batched input values for n runs as described in the submission, all provided in the `{multiple_run_data}` variable, and runs the project for each input in a loop within a single session, collecting session output accordingly.
- For each run, reads and extracts the session conversation data from the designated json/txt output file, located in `{output_file_path}` within the existing project directory submitted by the user and not the project that is running the script you generate

# Steps

1. Inspect the project files present at the specified directory path:
    - Detect all requirements and dependencies.
    - Locate the main entry point (e.g. app.py, cli.py, main.py).
    - Identify how to launch or interact with the project (Flask route, CLI command, etc.).
    - Determine the input mechanism (file, stdin, API, etc.) and the output file format/location.
2. Write a Python script which:
    - Creates and activates a virtual environment in a subfolder (e.g., `.venv`).
    - Installs all required packages (`pip install -r requirements.txt`, or as inferred).
    - Runs the project by launching its entry point (e.g., starting Flask, running CLI).
    - Iterates over all input data items in `{multiple_run_data}` and feeds each to the project appropriately for each run in the session.
    - After completion, loads and parses the output file containing the session conversation. The output file will always be located at `{output_file_path}`.
    - Extracts and displays (or saves) the complete conversation results for each run.

# Output Format

Output a complete Python script (as markdown, do not use code blocks unless specifically requested) that performs the above steps. The script should be ready to use in a single command, without manual setup beyond pointing to the existing extracted project directory.

- The script should be output as a single, continuous code listing.
- Variables, file paths, launch commands, and batched input data should use placeholders (e.g., `[project_entry.py]`, `[input_file.json]`, `{output_file_path}`, `{multiple_run_data}`).
- Include comments for main steps and where project-specific logic is applied.
- For cases where the launch method is uncertain, note points for adaptation.

# Examples

Example 1:

**Input**  
A project already extracted and present in:
- `project_dir/app.py` (Flask server)
- `project_dir/requirements.txt`
- `project_dir/input.json`
- `{output_file_path}` (e.g., `project_dir/output/session_output.json`)
- `{multiple_run_data}` (e.g., a list of input dicts for n runs)

**Script Output**  
(Real script should be longer and include full paths and proper subprocess logic.)
<script>
import os
import subprocess
import sys
import json

# Step 1: Set up virtual environment (do not extract files)
subprocess.run([sys.executable, '-m', 'venv', 'project_dir/.venv'])

# Step 2: Install requirements
subprocess.run(['project_dir/.venv/bin/pip', 'install', '-r', 'project_dir/requirements.txt'])

# Step 3: Launch flask (adjust as needed)
flask_proc = subprocess.Popen(['project_dir/.venv/bin/python', 'project_dir/app.py'])

# Step 4: Iterate over multiple_run_data
for run_data in {multiple_run_data}:
    # Send run_data as input to app via HTTP or other means as required

# Step 5: After run, extract output
with open('{output_file_path}') as outp:
    session_results = json.load(outp)
    print('Session Conversation:', session_results)
</script>
# Notes

- Do NOT extract or modify any project files. 
- For ambiguous entrypoints or input mechanisms, leave TODO comments.
- Always extract reasoning steps before conclusion data when extracting from output files.
- Scripts must not require manual steps for setup.
- Placeholders (like `[input.json]`, `[app.py]`, `{output_file_path}`, `{multiple_run_data}`) must be replaced for specific projects. 

# Notes

- Always handle variable input/output formats.
- Include error handling for missing files, requirements, or entrypoints.
- If the reasoning or extraction is performed after extraction, reverse the output order so that reasoning is shown first, then conclusion/result at the end.
- Only the final Python script should be output; do not include additional commentary or markdown sections.
- The output path containing the output will always be in `{output_file_path}`.
- The batched input for n runs must be provided in `{multiple_run_data}` as per your submission.
- The script should be present within tags <script> and </script>.
